## About reBloom  
# reBloom

reBloom is a small web application designed to help urban gardeners plan and learn about growing fruits, vegetables, and herbs. It features:

- **Crop Calendars** that show when to plant and harvest a wide variety of species common in Portugal (e.g., lettuce, tomatoes, citrus, and more).
- An **interactive plant-guessing game** (“Flora Guesser”) that tests botanical knowledge by asking users to identify plants from photographs.
- **Cultivation Guides** for both micro-scale (balcony/patio) and small-scale (home garden) projects, with detailed tips on each crop’s light, soil, and watering needs.
- A **responsive layout** using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—no frameworks—so you can open any page locally in a browser or view it via GitHub Pages.

> **Academic Context:**  
> reBloom was built as part of the Multimedia Laboratory 3, a Module of the Multimedia and Communication Technologies course from the University of Aveiro, Portugal. It is not a commercial or production application but rather a student project, demonstrating HTML/CSS/JS skills and an understanding of web-based interactions and user interfaces.
